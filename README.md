A drone is a type of aircraft. The drone is also known as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The drone is “empty” because it does not require the pilot to fly. A lowly person flies a plane without a plane. Some drones are controlled by a remote control. Some are controlled by computers. Some are being flown thousands of miles away. Drones are available in various sizes and shapes. Many have cameras that take pictures or record video.
Use of plant protection products is one of the most important agricultural activities to to meet the production of hard food all the time. A Drone mounted with sprayer mainly consists of BLDC motors, Li-Po (Lithium polymer)
batteries, pesticide tank, pump, and support frame. Six BLDC motors are included in hexa-copter frame to lift payload capacity. Li-Po battery is used to supply the required current required for the delivery system. A
conical-square water tank was used to hold an insecticide solution. The aluminum supporting frame was suitable used to mount a liquid spray tank, sprayer motor, spray and supporting legs (downhill gears) to get out and stay in a safe place.
